#ABOUT GridFile Creator
This tool is creating a tab-delimited file, that contains positions inside a specified range.
It can be used as input in some programs like SweeD or OmegaPlus.
The format of this file is "chr <tab> pos". The following example, will make it clear!
It is like a bed file, but it is not defining areas of interest, but points, inside an area.



#EXAMPLE
-----------------------------
$ python GridFileCreator.py -c 1 -s 100 -e 220 -n 7
[Creating points completed]
Area: 100 - 220
Distance:20
[DEBUGGING MSG] 7/7 points created and exported to points.1.100.220.out

$ cat points.1.100.220.out

chr1	120
chr1	140
chr1	160
chr1	180
